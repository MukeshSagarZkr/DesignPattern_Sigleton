**#Singleton Design Pattern**

The Singleton design pattern is one of the simplest design patterns. This pattern ensures that the class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it. The pattern ensures that only one object of a specific class is ever created. All further references to objects of the singleton class refer to the same underlying instance.

There are situations in a project where we want only one instance of the object to be created and shared among the clients. No client can create an instance from outside. It is more appropriate than creating a global variable since it may be copied and lead to multiple access points.
